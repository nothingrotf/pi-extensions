### Worktree and simulator cleanup

**You own the disk and the safety gate.** Prune merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators to reclaim space. Deletion is irreversible, so every step guards against deleting something in use or holding uncommitted work.

1. Snapshot and audit. Record `df -h /`, then run `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (principle-build-the-lever). It reads every path from `git worktree list`. It classifies each worktree by size, age, merge state, uncommitted work, remote state, and PR state.
2. The bucket is advice, not permission. Cross-check candidates against active `Task` runs and relevant `session_history` records (principle-prove-it-works). If no tool can establish usage, hold the worktree and ask before deletion.
3. Verify usage before deleting. For each ambiguous row, use read-only subagents to inspect the bounded session records and retained run evidence (principle-guard-the-context-window). Treat every worktree of an active or retained writer as in use.
4. Pause on irreversible loss. `wip:N` is N tracked uncommitted edits. Show the diff and get a decision first, since removing a clean worktree is recoverable from its branch but uncommitted work is gone. `scratch:N` is untracked throwaway, safe to drop, but name the files. Per Autonomy, clean and merged and not-in-use proceeds; `wip` and in-use pause.
5. Prune the confirmed set. Per path, `git worktree remove --force <path>`; if the dir survives on ignored build artifacts, `rm -rf` it, then `git worktree prune`. Branch refs survive, so no commits are lost. Confirm with `df -h /` and re-list.
6. Simulators and other reclaimers. Simulators are usually the next-biggest win. `xcrun simctl --set testing delete all` (XCTestDevices clones), `xcrun simctl delete unavailable`, and `xcrun simctl runtime list` then `runtime delete <id>` for old runtimes. More when needed: Xcode `DerivedData` and `iOS DeviceSupport`; package caches (pnpm, uv, brew, yarn). Clear only caches the user has not said to keep.

This is the one playbook that deletes user state with no code review to catch a slip, so the gates above are the review.

**Reply:** `df -h /` before and after with space reclaimed, the worktrees pruned, and a one-line reason for each held back (in-use by which chat, or uncommitted work).
